This is a mobile android app that is that notifies a user when another GameSlap user is in close proximity. If one of the users issues a slap (challenge) the other user can accept or reject the slap and they have to play a one on one game (thumb war, rock paper scissors etc.)

The app is still in development. The app uses phonegap to launch and build the app as a native app. It is hosted on phonegap. We use staticmatic gem to debug in the browser and ngrok to debug on an android device. The server side has user information that is uploaded onto a Heroku website. http://limitless-journey-1073.herokuapp.com/

Future Features:
  Push notifications
  Randomize game choices
  Ranking system
  Badges (gamefication)
  Lauch to iOS
